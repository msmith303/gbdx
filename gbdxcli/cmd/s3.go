	Use:   "s3",
	Short: "Interface to S3 Storage Service",
	Long: `GBDX stores ancillary data and derived products in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. When a workflow is run on the GBDX platform, a task called "StageDataToS3" is typically the last task run by the workflow. This task takes the processed data and places it in the AWS S3 bucket.

The purpose of the GBDX S3 Storage Service is to allow users to access this data. The service provides the temporary credentials required to access a Prefix, Folder, or Object in the S3 bucket.

For more details, see https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/s3-storage-service-course`,
